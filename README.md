# Machine Learning for House Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for predicting house prices using a machine learning model. The model is trained on the King County House Sales dataset, and the prediction is based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.

## Features
- **GUI Interface:** Utilizes Tkinter for a graphical user interface to input house details and get price predictions.
- **Linear Regression Model:** The machine learning model is built using scikit-learn's linear regression algorithm.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including feature engineering and binning of certain variables.
- **Dependencies:** Requires pandas, scikit-learn, and Tkinter.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the GUI interface navigating to dist/gui.exe`.
4. Input house details and click "Predict" to get the predicted house price.

## Dataset
The King County House Sales dataset (`kc_house_data.csv`) is used for training and testing the model. The dataset includes information about house features, location, and sale prices.
